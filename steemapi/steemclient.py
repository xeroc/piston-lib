class ExampleConfig():
    """ The behavior of your program (e.g. reactions on messages) can be
        defined in a separated class (here called ``Config()``. It contains
        the wallet and witness connection parameters:

        The config class is used to define several attributes *and*
        methods that will be used during API communication. This is
        particularily useful when dealing with event-driven websocket
        notifications.

        **RPC-Only Connections**:

        The simples setup for this class is a simply RPC:

        .. code-block:: python

            class Config():
                wallet_host           = "localhost"
                wallet_port           = 8092
                wallet_user           = ""
                wallet_password       = ""

        and allows the use of rpc commands similar to the
        ``SteemWalletRPC`` class:

        .. code-block:: python

            steem = SteemClient(Config)
            print(steem.rpc.info())
            print(steem.rpc.get_account("init0"))
            print(steem.rpc.get_asset("USD"))

        All methods within ``steem.rpc`` are mapped to the corresponding
        RPC call **of the wallet** and the parameters are handed over
        directly.

        **Additional Websocket Connections**:

        .. code-block:: python

            class Config():  ## Note the dependency
                wallet_host           = "localhost"
                wallet_port           = 8092
                wallet_user           = ""
                wallet_password       = ""
                witness_url           = "ws://localhost:8090/"
                witness_user          = ""
                witness_password      = ""

        All methods within ``steem.ws`` are mapped to the corresponding
        RPC call of the **full/witness node** and the parameters are handed
        over directly.

    """

    wallet_host = "localhost"
    wallet_port = 8092
    wallet_user = ""
    wallet_password = ""

    #: Witness connection parameter
    witness_url = "ws://localhost:8090/"
    witness_user = ""
    witness_password = ""


class SteemClient():
    """ The ``SteemClient`` class is an abstraction layer that makes the use of the
        RPC and the websocket interface easier to use. A part of this
        abstraction layer is to simplyfy the usage of objects and have
        an internal objects map updated to reduce unecessary queries
        (for enabled websocket connections). Advanced developers are of
        course free to use the underlying API classes instead as well.
